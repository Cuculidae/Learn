/*
 * Associative containers (both ordered and unordered) support the general
 * container operations covered in ยง 9.2 (p. 328) and listed in Table 9.2 (p.
 * 330). The associative containers do not support the sequential-container
 * position-specific operations, such as push_front or back. Because the
 * elements are stored based on their keys, these operations would be
 * meaningless for the associative containers. Moreover, the associative
 * containers do not support the constructors or insert operations that take an
 * element value and a count.
 *
 * The associative container iterators are bidirectional.
 *
 * For the ordered containers--map, multimap, set, andmultiset--the key type
 * must define a way to compare the elements. By default, the library uses the <
 * operator for the key type to compare the keys.
 *
 * The type of the operation that a container uses to organize its elements is
 * part of the type of that container. To specify our own operation, we must
 * supply the type of that operationwhenwe define the type of an associative
 * container. The operation type is specified following the element type inside
 * the angle brackets that we use to say which type of container we are
 * defining.
 *
 * Associative Container Additional Type Aliases:
 * key_type     Type of the key for this container type
 * mapped_type  Type associated with each key; map types only
 * value_type   For sets, same as the key_type
 *              For maps, pair<const key_type, mapped_type>
 *
 * In general, we do not use the generic algorithms (Chapter 10) with the
 * associative containers. The fact that the keys are constmeans that we cannot
 * pass associative container iterators to algorithms that write to or reorder
 * container elements. Associative containers can be used with the algorithms
 * that read elements. However, many of these algorithms search the sequence. In
 * practice, if we do so at all, we use an associative container with the
 * algorithms either as the source sequence or as a destination.
 * 
 * When we use an iterator to traverse a map, multimap, set, or multiset, the
 * iterators yield elements in ascending key order.
 *
 * There can be several elements with the same key in the multimap and multiset
 * containers.
